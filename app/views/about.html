    	<p>Every now and then, we all need a little peace and quiet, time to relax and play...a get away. MOD CABS are a collection of easy to build, modern, architect designed tiny house plans. Weather you want to fully detach with a primitive "no-grid" shelter, a sustaiable "off-the-grid" retreat, or a fully functional (but simple) home...we've got you covered. Our plans range in size from 150 - 1000 square feet and designs are optimized by climate type.</p>
